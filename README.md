Unique Product Card Design

Description

This project is a modern and interactive product card design that displays product details with a smooth flip animation effect. Users can toggle dark mode and interact with the product cards, which include a "Buy Now" button.

Features

Dynamic Product Cards: Product details are dynamically generated from an array in JavaScript.

Flip Animation: Hovering over a card flips it to reveal additional product details.

Dark Mode Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark mode.

Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

Interactive "Buy Now" Button: Clicking logs the selected product in the console.

Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the webpage.

CSS: For styling, animations, and dark mode.

JavaScript: For dynamic content generation and event handling.

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository or download the files.

Ensure all files (HTML, CSS, JS, and images) are in the same directory.
